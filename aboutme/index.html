    <h2>William Hanford</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is William Hanford and I am from the Orlando Florida area. 
        I am a senior majoring with a Bachelor's in Graphic Design with an emphasis in UI/UX (User Interface User Experience).
    This involves creating user friendly experiences for users of digital services like apps and websites.
    I am taking this course to learn about the code involved in creating interfaces like websites, as UX designers typically work a lot with web developers and software engineers.

    <p>Some things I like to do in my free time is playing the piano, drawing, and hanging out with my friends. I have been a member
        of the church my whole life. I served my mission in the Colorado, Colorado Springs mission from Jan 2019 to Dec 2020 and I absolutely
        loved it, despite having served basically my second half during the pandemic. 
    </p>
    <p>I'm excited to be here!</p>
