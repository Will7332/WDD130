                <p>Here is my first cartographic temple map! As a student at BYU-Idaho, I have been inspired to illustrate the local temples
                    and the geography of the state, starting out with the Rexburg temple, followed by the Idaho Falls temple. After completing
                    the current temples in operation, I decided to include future temples for anyone interested. I used the renders released by the
                    church to create these illustrations based off of them in their respective locations.</p>

                <img src = "images/FloridaTemples.png">
                <p> My second cartographic temple map, I decided to do my home state of Florida. I have grown up going to the Orlando temple, the only temple in Florida for a long time.
                    While it was only a half hour drive for me, seeing the growth of the church in my state the past decade leading to now 5 total temples being either announced or constructed has brought
                    me joy, leading to the inspiration of creating this map.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src = "images/ColoradoTemples.png">
                <p>
                    Having served my mission in Colorado, I knew I had to make a temples map of this state. 
                    I served in the Colorado Springs mission, where thenearest temple was Denver. However The CO Springs temple was recently announced and 
                    will be the 4th temple to be built in the state.

                <img src = "images/NortheastTemples.png">
                <p>
                    Growing up I have taken many road trips along the East Coast, and have explored many places in the Northeastern part of the country. 
                    This map displaysthe unique array of temples in this region, particularly based off of the colonial roots of the US.

                <p>
                    There have been significant church events that have occured within this region, in particular with Ohio and Illinois. 
                    I have also had the privelage of visiting church sites in this region, including in Nauvoo and western Missouri.

            <div>

                <p>
                    I first created a map solely for temples in Southern California because there were enough to fit in one map. 
                    After creating that map I thought to myself I might as well the rest of California. The state has a total of 12 temples either dedicated, constructed or announced.

                <p>
                    I have personal family roots from this region, which led to the inspiration of creating the Mexico City temple where my parents got sealed, and the new Puebla temple 
                    which is where my mother's family is from. Recenty President Nelson has announced 5 more temples to be built in the Mexico City vicinity, 
                    which include Pachuca, Tula, Toluca, Cuernavaca and Benemerito.
