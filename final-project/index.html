                <h1>Welcome to my LDS Temple Map Portfolio!</h1>
                <p>Here, you'll find a collection of digital, illustrationed 3D maps of LDS Temples in different areas. 
                    Each map is a unique blend of creativity and devotion, capturing the beauty and significance of these sacred places in a fun 
                    and artistic way. Whether you're a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or simply appreciate the architecture

        <h1>How do I make them?</h1>
        <div>
            <p>For each map, I start by selecting a region to focus on and the temples I want to feature. I then explore the general architecture and 
                geography of each temple to understand how best to represent them in a unique way. The creation process begins in ArcGIS Pro, 
                where I design a cartographic 3D map of the region. I then import a photo of this map as a layer into Adobe Illustrator.</p>
            <p>Using this as a guide, 
                I carefully illustrate the temples on top of the map layer, adding detailed touches to enhance the overall aesthetic. I have decided to also
                create maps that include the future sites of temples if their renderings are available. After some finishing touches of the map
                such as labels and styling, it leaves with the final result, a one-of-a-kind artistic map that combines accuracy with creativity, highlighting 
                the beauty and uniqueness of each temple.</p>
