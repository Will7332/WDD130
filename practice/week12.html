        <p>The piano is more than just an instrument; it's a gateway to self-expression and creativity. 
            Whether you're a beginner just starting your musical journey or someone returning to the keys after years, 
            the piano offers endless opportunities to create beauty. Its versatility allows you to explore anything from

    <button class="accordion">The Benefits of Learning Piano</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Learning to play the piano sharpens your mind and soothes your soul. It enhances cognitive skills, improves memory, 
            and strengthens hand-eye coordination. Beyond the technical benefits, piano playing is a wonderful stress reliever,
            allowing you to unwind and connect with your emotions. No matter your age, mastering the keys builds discipline, patience, 
            and a sense of accomplishment.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Getting Started on Your Journey</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Starting your piano journey doesn't require expensive lessons or a grand piano. 
            Begin with a simple keyboard or digital piano and commit to consistent practice. 
            Focus on learning the basics—like scales, chords, and simple songs—and set small goals to track your progress. 
            With dedication and passion, you'll find that even a few minutes of practice a day can unlock a lifetime of musical enjoyment.
